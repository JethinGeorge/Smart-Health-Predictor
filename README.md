#  Smart Health Risk Predictor using Machine Learning

The **Smart Health Risk Predictor** is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of a user having certain health conditions based on input parameters like age, symptoms, and medical history. It aims to provide early risk insights and assist in proactive healthcare.


##  Project Overview

- 🧠 **Purpose**: Predict health risks using ML
- 🗂️ **Input**: User data (age, weight, symptoms, blood pressure, etc.)
- 🏷️ **Output**: Risk prediction for diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease)
- 🌐 **Interface**: User-friendly web UI


##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Flask (for web interface)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend)
- Google Colab / Jupyter (for training)

---

##  Features

- Clean web interface for input
- Predictive model trained on healthcare data
- Multi-disease prediction capability (based on design)
- Real-time prediction using user inputs

##  How to Run

###  For ML Model (Notebook):
1. Open `sh.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Load and preprocess the dataset
3. Train the model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
4. Save the trained model (`.pkl`)

###  For Web Application (Flask):
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
